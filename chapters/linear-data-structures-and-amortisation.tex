\section{Array}

An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements in contiguous memory locations.

Time Complexity:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Access at index: $O(1)$
  \item Insert at the end: $O(1)$
  \item Insert at the front: $O(n)$
  \item Insert in the middle: $O(n)$
  \item Delete at the end: $O(1)$
  \item Delete at the front: $O(n)$
  \item Delete at the middle: $O(n)$
  \item Modify at index: $O(1)$
\end{itemize}

Space Complexity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $O(n)$
\end{itemize}

\section{Singly Linked List}
A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value, and a pointer to the next node in the sequence. The structure allows for traversal forward but not backward. The first node is called the head and does not have a previous node and thus has a pointer to null.

Time Complexity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Access head: $O(1)$
    \item Remove head: $O(1)$
    \item Insert head: $O(1)$
    \item Modify head: $O(1)$
    \item Access index: $O(n)$
    \item Remove index: $O(n)$
    \item Insert index: $O(n)$
    \item Modify index: $O(n)$
\end{itemize}

Space Complexity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $O(n)$
\end{itemize}

\section{Doubly Linked List}
A singly linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequences of nodes, where each node contains a value, and two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node. The structure allows for traversal forward and backward. The first node is called the head and does not have a previous node and thus has a pointer to null. The last node is called the tail and does not have a next node and thus has a pointer to null.

Time Complexity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Access head: $O(1)$
    \item Remove head: $O(1)$
    \item Insert head: $O(1)$
    \item Modify head: $O(1)$
    \item Access tail: $O(1)$
    \item Remove tail: $O(1)$
    \item Insert tail: $O(1)$
    \item Modify tail: $O(1)$
    \item Access index: $O(n)$
    \item Remove index: $O(n)$
    \item Insert index: $O(n)$
    \item Modify index: $O(n)$
\end{itemize}

Space Complexity:

\begin{itemize}
    \item $O(n)$
\end{itemize}

\section{Circularly Linked List}
A circularly linked list is a data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes, where each node contains a value, and two pointers: one to the next node and one to the previous node. Similar to a Doubly Linked List, but the last node points back to the first node and the first node points back to the last node.

Time Complexity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Access head: $O(1)$
    \item Remove head: $O(1)$
    \item Insert head: $O(1)$
    \item Modify head: $O(1)$
    \item Access tail: $O(1)$
    \item Remove tail: $O(1)$
    \item Insert tail: $O(1)$
    \item Modify tail: $O(1)$
    \item Access index: $O(n)$
    \item Remove index: $O(n)$
    \item Insert index: $O(n)$
    \item Modify index: $O(n)$
\end{itemize}

Space Complexity:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $O(n)$
\end{itemize}

\section{Amortisation}

Amortisation is a method for evaluating the efficiency of an algorithm by averaging the cost of a sequence of operations over time, rather than focusing on the worst-case cost of operations.
